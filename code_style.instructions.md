When writing code, follow these style guidelines to ensure consistency and readability across the project:
- Use 2 spaces for indentation instead of tabs.
- Limit lines to a maximum of 80 characters.  
- Use camelCase for variable and function names.
- Use PascalCase for class names.
- Always use semicolons at the end of statements.
- Use single quotes for strings unless the string contains a single quote that would require escaping.
- Place opening braces on the same line as the control statement or function declaration.
- Include a space after keywords like `if`, `for`, `while`, and before the
opening parenthesis.
- Use descriptive names for variables and functions to enhance code readability.
- Add comments to explain complex logic, but avoid over-commenting obvious code.
- Organize imports at the top of the file, grouped by external and internal modules.
- Ensure consistent spacing around operators (e.g., `=`, `+`, `-`, `===`).
- Write unit tests for new features and bug fixes to maintain code quality.
- Regularly run a linter to catch style violations and maintain code quality.
- Follow the project's specific conventions for error handling and logging.
- Keep functions small and focused on a single task to enhance maintainability.
- Add descriptive JSDoc comments for public APIs and complex functions.
- Include input validation and error handling in functions to ensure robustness.
- Use early returns for error conditions to reduce nested code and improve readability.
- Add meaningful variable and function names that convey purpose clearly.
- Include at least one example usage in comments for complex functions or classes.
